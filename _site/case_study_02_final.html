<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For this case study, we investigated the CaseStudy02 dataset. The dataset contained 870 entries with 36 feature vectors. Through the analysis, we were able to classify potential <code>Attrition</code> for employees with greater than 70% accuracy as well as predict income rates with an RMSE of 1387. In addition, we overcame several unforeseen challenges in the dataset.</p>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>In this section we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the CaseStudy-2 dataset. This dataset can be found in the <code>datasets</code> directory for the project. The project will attempt to investigate the data by performing the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine the dimensions of the dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Address non-informative / missing features.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the correlation values between numeric features and the <code>Attrition</code> variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Comment on the distribution of <code>Attrition</code> variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the correlation values between categorical features and the <code>Attrition</code> variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify any relationship between the <code>Attrition</code> variable and other variables in the dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the correlation values between numeric features and the <code>MonthlyIncome</code> variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify any relationship between the <code>MonthlyIncome</code> variable and other variables in the dataset.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Build a classification model to predict attrition with &gt;60% specificity and &gt;60% selectivity</h3>
<p>For classification we will train a Naive Bayes classifier. The features used for training the model were identified by their relationship to the <code>Attrition</code> variable. Additionally, we use down sampling and invert the percentage of training samples versus their respective population. As a result, we use ~70% of the <code>Attrition=yes</code> samples and ~30% of the <code>Attrition=No</code> samples to build a training set containing ~30% of the data available. The remaining ~70% of the dataset is used for testing.</p>
<p>This process is executed 100 times with different seed values.</p>
